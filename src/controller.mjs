// The one place browser state lives. It owns what is loaded, what is being
// edited, and which action envelope is in flight; it renders nothing and knows
// no HTML. Everything it reads or writes goes through the injected store and
// auth modules, so the same controller runs in the browser and against doubles.
//
// Three rules this file exists to keep:
//
//   * **savedCase and draftAnswers are different things.** A remote change
//     replaces what the server says; it never rewrites what the person typed.
//     When the two diverge the controller says so (`conflict`) and refuses to
//     save until a human chooses. Pending edits are never silently rebased.
//   * **An unknown outcome keeps its envelope.** A timed-out action is retried
//     as the identical object — same action id, payload, persona and expected
//     revision — so the server replays its receipt instead of acting twice.
//   * **Window state is per window and per user.** Selection, screen, sub-step,
//     open panels, the persona and the board's filters live in session storage
//     under the authenticated user's id, so two windows disagree freely and two
//     accounts never share a view. That storage is a collaborator of its own
//     (`window-state.mjs`, Ruling R44); this file decides what the values mean.

// the caller's own list is ignored rather than trusted — which is also what
