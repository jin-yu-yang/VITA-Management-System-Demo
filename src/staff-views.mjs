// The two staff screens for preparers and reviewers — the work board and the
// selected case — as pure functions. No state, no store, no timers, no DOM:
// each returns an HTML string, and every value that came from a person or from
// the database is escaped on the way out.
//
// Four conventions hold throughout:
//
//   * workflow buttons carry `data-case-action` with a name from CASE_ACTIONS,
//     and any related id in `data-request-id` / `data-followup-id`; forms put
//     that attribute on their submit button and name their fields after the
//     payload keys (`src/case-actions.mjs` turns the two into a payload);
//   * navigation and filters carry `data-action` and never become an action;
//   * stage words come from `describeStage` and names from `decorateStaffCase`
//     — this file invents neither;
//   * a person who may not do something sees the reason, not a missing button.
//     `staffEligibility` is the one place those rules live, so the board and
//     the case workspace can never disagree about who may act.
//
// There is no amount, refund, bank or routing field anywhere in this demo, so
// none is ever rendered: ViTally records the workflow, and the return itself
// lives in the tax software.
//
// The section renderers a second staff screen needs — the header, the answers
// summary, the requests/documents list and the history — are **exported** (the
// office workspace in `admin-views.mjs` imports them, Ruling R55). They are
// shared, not copied: one case can never describe itself two ways depending on
// which volunteer is looking at it. The same goes for the small vocabularies
// below and for `explain`, so a refusal reads the same on every screen.
