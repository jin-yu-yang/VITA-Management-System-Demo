//     and any related id in `data-request-id` / `data-followup-id`;
//   * assistance controls carry `data-assistance-action="CLAIM"|"RESOLVE"` with

//     its own revision and its own list, so it has its own attribute and the

//   * navigation, filters and dialogs carry `data-action`;
//   * a person who may not do something sees the reason, not a missing button.
