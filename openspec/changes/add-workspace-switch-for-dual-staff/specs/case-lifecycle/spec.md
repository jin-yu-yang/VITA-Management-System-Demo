## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Screening starts when an admin first opens a case
When a staff window opens a case's page at Request sent while it is in the office workspace, the window SHALL start screening for that case. A window is in the office workspace when its selected persona is an admin. A staff account with the Office / Cases switch is in the office workspace only in Office mode. The window SHALL start screening whether the case page was opened by its reference, the search, Follow-ups, the case pool or a reload. It SHALL also start it when the persona is switched to an admin, or a dual staff account is switched to Office, while the case page is open. A list control that acts on a case without opening its page (for example Log contact on Follow-ups) SHALL NOT start screening. A window acting as a volunteer persona, or a dual staff account in Cases mode, SHALL start nothing. The start SHALL be sent once per case.

**Quietly:**
- It SHALL NOT disable the page's buttons.
- It SHALL NOT show an error, a Try again or a toast for itself.
- When another admin started screening first, or the case changed meanwhile, the window SHALL re-read the case and show it at Screening in progress.
- When the connection is down, the case SHALL stay at Request sent under the connection notice, and the start SHALL be sent again once the connection returns while the case is open.

Starting screening SHALL tell the client (see "Clients are told at each new step"). It SHALL NOT be undone.

#### Scenario: An admin opens a new application
- **WHEN** Sam, acting as an admin, opens a case at Request sent
- **THEN** the case moves to Screening in progress, the client's page shows "Being reviewed", and the client's history gains "PCDC started reviewing your application. We may call you."

#### Scenario: Two admins open it at once
- **WHEN** two admin windows open the same Request sent case
- **THEN** the case moves to Screening in progress once, and neither window shows an error

#### Scenario: A volunteer opens it
- **WHEN** a window acting as a volunteer opens a case at Request sent
- **THEN** the case stays at Request sent

#### Scenario: A dual staff account in Cases opens it
- **WHEN** a staff member with `admin` and `review`, in Cases mode, opens a case at Request sent
- **THEN** the case stays at Request sent

#### Scenario: A dual staff account switches to Office on the case
- **WHEN** that staff member then switches to Office with the case page still open
- **THEN** the case moves to Screening in progress

#### Scenario: A reload on the case page
- **WHEN** an admin window reloads while it shows a case at Request sent
- **THEN** the case moves to Screening in progress

#### Scenario: Logging a contact from Follow-ups
- **WHEN** an admin logs a contact from a Follow-ups row for a case at Request sent, without opening its page
- **THEN** the case stays at Request sent

#### Scenario: Offline on open
- **WHEN** an admin opens a Request sent case while the connection is down, and the connection then returns
- **THEN** no error is shown, and once connected the case moves to Screening in progress
