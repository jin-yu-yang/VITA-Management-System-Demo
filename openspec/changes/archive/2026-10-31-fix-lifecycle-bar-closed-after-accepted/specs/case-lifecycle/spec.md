## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The lists and the case page show every stage
**The work board** SHALL keep its three tabs:
- **Available:** Pending intake / filing with no preparer.
- **Waiting for preparation:** Filing in progress and Corrections in progress.
- **Waiting for review:** Pending review and Review in progress.

Its search SHALL reach a case in any stage.

**The case pool** SHALL have these tabs, in this order: All, Intake (Draft, Request sent, Screening in progress), Available, Waiting for preparation, Waiting for review, Waiting on client (Waiting for documents, Ready to exit), Filing (Ready to e-file, E-filed), Needs attention (Hold, Rejected), Done (Accepted), and Closed. Its stage filter SHALL list every stage. The Closed tab SHALL have a reason filter: All, each of the six reasons, and No reason (cases closed before reasons existed). The pool, Follow-ups and the case page SHALL show E-filed and Accepted by their staff name for the case's filing method.

**Follow-ups** SHALL show an admin **Close unsigned cases…** above its rows (see "An admin closes unsigned cases at season end"), and:
- a row for each case at Request sent ("New application: open it to start screening."), with **Open**;
- a row for each case at Screening in progress ("Finish screening."), with **Open**;
- a **Waiting for documents** row for each case at Waiting for documents ("Waiting for the client's documents."), with **Put on hold…**;
- a **Hold** row for each case on Hold: "Can't reach the client about documents." for a Hold that came from Waiting for documents, or "Can't reach the client to sign." for one that came from Ready to exit. It has **Got in touch…** and **Close…**;
- a **Withdrawn** row for each open `withdrawal_notice` follow-up, with **Resolve**. It reads "The client withdrew; tell <name> to stop work." for a client's own withdrawal during preparation or review, "The client withdrew; make sure the return is not transmitted in TaxSlayer." for an admin's withdrawn close at Ready to exit, a Hold from Ready to exit, or Ready to e-file, or "The case was closed before filing; make sure the return is not transmitted in TaxSlayer." for an admin's individual close of a Hold from Ready to exit with any other reason;
- a row for each case at Ready to exit ("Waiting for the client to sign."), with **Mark ready to e-file…**. While the reviewer's call with the client is still pending, the row SHALL read "Waiting for the reviewer's call with the client." instead, with the call-pending explanation in place of the button. For a case returned to signing after a rejection, the row SHALL read "Waiting for the client to sign again.";
- a row for each case at Ready to e-file ("Ready to e-file."), with **Mark e-filed…**;
- a **Filing result** row for each case at E-filed, and for each case at Rejected with an e-filed return still waiting, with **Record filing result…**. It SHALL read "Waiting for the IRS and Pennsylvania." while both returns wait, or "Waiting for Pennsylvania's answer." or "Waiting for the IRS's answer." while one e-filed return waits. A return on paper SHALL never be waited for;
- a **Rejected** row for each case at Rejected ("Rejected: contact the client to fix and sign again."), followed by the latest fix note, as typed, if there is one. It has **Return to signing…**, or, while an e-filed return still waits, "Waiting for Pennsylvania's answer before the return can go back to signing." (or "…the IRS's answer…") in its place;

alongside today's rows. A case at Accepted SHALL have no row. Follow-ups' filter SHALL list every kind. A row's waiting time SHALL count from the case's last move or recorded result.

The amber (3 days) and red (5 days) colouring SHALL apply to a Waiting for documents row and to a Filing result row. A Hold row, a Withdrawn row and a Rejected row SHALL never be coloured.

**The case page:**
- Its lifecycle bar SHALL show Request sent, Screening in progress, Pending intake / filing, Filing in progress, Pending review, Review in progress, Ready to exit, Ready to e-file, E-filed and Accepted. Accepted SHALL be the bar's last step: the bar SHALL NOT show Closed after Accepted for any case that is not closed. At Accepted every step SHALL be shown done, and no step SHALL be shown as the current one. A closed case's bar SHALL show Closed after Accepted as its only current step, and every step before it SHALL be shown neutral: neither done nor still to come. Where a closed case stopped SHALL be read in its History tab. Corrections in progress SHALL show on Filing in progress, and Rejected on E-filed. Waiting for documents SHALL show on the stage it was asked from. Hold SHALL show on the stage it came from: Ready to exit, or the stage the documents were asked from.
- For an admin, the intake-check form SHALL show at Screening in progress only.
- For an admin, the office actions panel SHALL offer Ask for documents…, Put on hold…, Got in touch… and Close… at the stages their moves allow. Close… SHALL offer the six reasons and the note.
- For an admin, the signing panel SHALL be headed "Signing". At a Hold that came from Ready to exit it SHALL say "The office could not reach the client to sign.", and before Ready to e-file it SHALL say "This is recorded once the client has signed.".
- At Request sent, the case page SHALL say that screening starts when an admin opens the case.
- A volunteer's "Your next step" SHALL say what each new stage is waiting for:
  - Waiting for documents: "The office is waiting for the client's documents.";
  - Hold: "The office is trying to reach the client.";
  - E-filed: "The office records the answers from the IRS and Pennsylvania.";
  - Rejected: "A return was rejected. The site coordinator fixes it in TaxSlayer, and the office contacts the client.";
  - Accepted: "The returns are accepted or given to the client on paper. Nothing more is needed here.".
- The case's history SHALL name each new move. Mark ready to e-file SHALL read "recorded the client's signature".

- **THEN** the first lists only cases on Hold and Rejected cases, and the second only Accepted cases

#### Scenario: Waiting on client
- **WHEN** an admin opens the case pool's Waiting on client tab
- **THEN** it lists the cases at Waiting for documents and Ready to exit, and no other

#### Scenario: Closed by reason

#### Scenario: A late acknowledgment turns amber
- **WHEN** a both-e-filed case has waited three days at E-filed with no answer recorded
- **THEN** its Filing result row is amber, and reads "Waiting for the IRS and Pennsylvania."

#### Scenario: A mailing row is never coloured
- **WHEN** a case was filed with the federal return on paper and the state return e-filed, and has waited six days at E-filed
- **THEN** no row waits for a mailing: its Filing result row reads "Waiting for Pennsylvania's answer.", is coloured red for Pennsylvania's wait, and mentions nothing about the paper return

#### Scenario: The Rejected row shows the fix note
- **WHEN** a case is Rejected with the fix note "Site coordinator to correct the dependent's SSN in TaxSlayer"
- **THEN** its Rejected row reads "Rejected: contact the client to fix and sign again." followed by that note, with Return to signing…

#### Scenario: Accepted leaves the queue
- **WHEN** the last waiting return of a case is recorded as accepted
- **THEN** the case has no Follow-ups row

#### Scenario: The bar of an Accepted case
- **WHEN** a staff member opens a case at Accepted
- **THEN** its lifecycle bar shows every step from Request sent to Accepted as done, no step as current, and no Closed

#### Scenario: The bar of a closed case
- **WHEN** a staff member opens a case that was closed from Pending review
- **THEN** its lifecycle bar shows Closed after Accepted as the current step, and every step from Request sent to Accepted as neutral, neither done nor still to come

#### Scenario: The bar of an open case ends at Accepted
- **WHEN** a staff member opens a case at Pending review
- **THEN** its lifecycle bar shows the steps before Pending review as done, Pending review as current, the steps from Review in progress to Accepted as still to come, and no Closed

#### Scenario: Rejected and Corrections in progress are unchanged
- **WHEN** a staff member opens a case at Rejected, and another at Corrections in progress
- **THEN** the first bar shows Rejected on the E-filed step and the second shows Corrections in progress on the Filing in progress step, each as the current step with the steps before it done
