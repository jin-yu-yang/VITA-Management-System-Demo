//   * **Only the send is simulated.** The exact guarded `/auth/v1/otp` URL is
//     intercepted so automation never asks a mail server for anything; the real
//     `/auth/v1/verify` is always untouched, so a passing login is a real one.
//   * **Users come from the database fixture.** It owns provisioning and
//     run-scoped cleanup; this file never creates an Auth user of its own.
